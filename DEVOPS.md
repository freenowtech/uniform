# Dev Ops ðŸš¢

## Summary

Create your PR and new version of the package would be published automatically when your PR is merged.

## Steps of devops automation

- We have CI & CD configured with Bamboo. Every commit triggers the build plan which can be seen in Bamboo. 
- Default build plan includes a test pipeline: eslint+prettier â†’ flow â†’ unit tests.
- After passing the tests library code would be transpiled via `babel`.
- Every successful build in master branch publishes the new version of the package with updated changelog.
- To modify this build you can look at the `/bamboo-specs` folder.
